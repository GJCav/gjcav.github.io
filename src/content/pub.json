In contrast to the previous studies, we propose a fast and lightweight model named as PTPCG. In our model, we design a novel strategy for event argument combination together with a non-autoregressive decoding algorithm via pruned complete graphs, which are constructed under the guidance of the automatically selected pseudo triggers. Compared to the previous systems, our system achieves competitive results with 19.8% of parameters and much lower resource consumption, taking only 3.8% GPU hours for training and up to 8.5 times faster for inference. Besides, our model shows superior compatibility for the datasets with (or without) triggers and the pseudo triggers can be the supplements for annotated triggers to make further improvements.

This task is challenging as the financial documents are generally long text and event arguments of one event may be scattered in different sentences. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Prior Information Enhanced Extraction framework (PIEE) for DFEE, leveraging prior information from both event types and pre-trained language models. Specifically, PIEE consists of three components: event detection, event argument extraction, and event table filling. In event detection, we identify the event type. Then, the event type is explicitly used for event argument extraction. Meanwhile, the implicit information within language models also provides considerable cues for event arguments localization. Finally, all the event arguments are filled in an event table by a set of predefined heuristic rules. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we participated in the share task of CCKS2020 Task 4-2: Document-level Event Arguments Extraction. On both Leaderboard A and Leaderboard B, PIEE took the first place and significantly outperformed the other systems.},\n}",

However, these DS-generated datasets inevitably have wrong labels that result in incorrect evaluation scores during testing, which may mislead the researchers. To solve this problem, we build a new dataset NYTH, where we use the DS-generated data as training data and hire annotators to label test data. Compared with the previous datasets, NYT-H has a much larger test set and then we can perform more accurate and consistent evaluation. Finally, we present the experimental results of several widely used systems on NYT-H. The experimental results show that the ranking lists of the comparison systems on the DS-labelled test data and human-annotated test data are different. This indicates that our human-annotated data is necessary for evaluation of distantly-supervised relation extraction. \", \n}",

Due to the limited size, the human-annotated data is usually incapable of covering diverse relation expressions, which could limit the performance of RE. To increase the coverage of relation expressions, we may enlarge the labeled data by hiring annotators or applying Distant Supervision (DS). However, the human-annotated data is costly and non-scalable while the distantly supervised data contains many noises. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to improve RE systems via enriching diverse expressions by relational paraphrase sentences. Based on an existing labeled data, we first automatically build a task-specific paraphrase data. Then, we propose a novel model to learn the information of diverse relation expressions. In our model, we try to capture this information on the paraphrases via a joint learning framework. Finally, we conduct experiments on a widely used dataset and the experimental results show that our approach is effective to improve the performance on relation extraction, even compared with a strong baseline.\",}",
